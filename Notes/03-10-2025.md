# Notes for 03-10-2025

Q:
What was it Fix was doing again?
A:
We can safely ignore Fix, but we still need to understand it for the report.
If we have a definition like Map, then it will use recursion and implicitly be a Fix.

there is a difference between fix and Fix. fix is for defining recursive functions, Fix is for defining recursive types.

```
map: box (A -> B) -> Sig A -> Sig B
map f (x::xs) = unbox :: delay ( map f (adv xs))
```

```
map = fix r. lambda f (x::xs) = unbox :: delay ( adv r f (adv xs))
    r = (later (box (A -> B) -> Sig A -> Sig B))
```

Maybe right?:
Fix is a type-level construct used to define recursive types in a way that avoids certain issues with infinite types. It allows us to create self-referential structures while maintaining type safety.

Q: 
What does the star circle mean?
A:
The star circle (âŠ›) : (forall)(A -> B) -> (forall A) -> (forall B)
If you have a later A and a later (A -> B), you can get a later B.
It is used to apply a polymorphic function to a polymorphic argument.

Q:
What does the later (>) mean?
A:
later A means that the value of type A will be available in the next time step. ??


Q:
*something about sync/select*
A:
sync: (forall A) -> (forall B) -> (forall (A + B + (A * B)))

type 'a + 'b = InL of 'a | InR of 'b
type 'a + 'b = In1 of 'a | In2 of 'b


Advice:
Last time we talked about the GA...

OA = universal later modality
OE = existential later modality

type 'a OA = () -> 'a

type _ OE =
    | App : ('a -> 'b) OA * 'a OE -> 'b OE
    | Sync : 'a OE * 'b OE -> ('a  'b Sync) OE
    | ...

type a' b' Sync = 
    | Fst of a'
    | Snd of b'
    | Both of a' * b'
