## Questions

- Garbage collection. Should we force gc after step? When is it safe to do? When can a node be deleted?
- I still don't quite fully understand the `trig` constructor. In the paper it reads as if it's supposed to be able to help us create signals from "maybe A" signals (as seen in the filter example). But `trig` creates something of type `OE(A)`, that is a single value of type `A` at a later time. Is the runtime supposed to have a `mkSig_from_oe` that treats such trips as repeated?
	- **Answer** => think of it as a channel on "internal signals". 
- Garbage collection? Should we force it? When can/can't we do it?
	- Little unfair with no code, but if we do not force a GC - then signals with side effects will do them too many times... and it sort of explodes our heap.
	- **Answer** => GC at inconvenient times is a consequence of the language choice, automatic reference count would have been "smarter".
		- Program should behave the same whether or not GC is called.
		- Problem is the call to print_endline - no side effects in our tails!
- **Tail semantics** => should be evaluated once, even if used in multiple signals
