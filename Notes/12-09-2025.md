# 12. of September 2025

Recommendations:
- Implement as a library in F# (or anything else with weak references and ideally reference counted), getting to know it, how does it work, simple optimisations.
	- Context
- (Or implement simple language, e.g. simple lambda calculi)

For master's thesis:
- Looking at the previous work (specifically the other group that compiled to WEBASM).

**Two heaps**
- A 'now' heap of current values, and a 'old' heap of the previous values. When input comes in (from the environment) time "ticks" and the 'new' heap becomes the 'old' heap. 
	- Update values on the "new' 'old' heap and move any still-in-use over to the 'new' heap.
- Linked list, ORDERED - may only reference upwards

**Plan**:
- First draft of a project statement. 
- Mail to Patrick by DATE (we have a meeting to discuss it on the 19th September)
