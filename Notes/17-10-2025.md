## Advance semantics:

- For now: Change `b` to an int
- polymorphic recursion => calling advance (a polymorphic function) with a new polymorphic parameter.
	- That's why we need the explicit type definition. 
	- https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/polymorphism.html is it explain here?
	- Happens because of the GADTs.
- *"Weak reference always come in arrays"*
- We're gonna have to cast the `wait` case of advance (hopefully no segfaults). `Obj.repr` => take the object representation as an argument and use it to cast the argument to the needed type.

## Next time:
- Get advance working (+ update, step)
- Are there any other things we did, that should be documented.
- Also, test(?) our heap, does it do what we wanted it to do?
