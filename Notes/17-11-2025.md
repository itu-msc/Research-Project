# 17th of November 2025

## Notes:

- **The tail problem** =>
  - The weird artifacts from multiple tails - originates from update semantics where $ticked(v_2)$ is true.
    - In ocaml we create a copy to a reference of the "delayed computation" (the tail) see the example from `heap.ml` below.
  - This is not a problem since language makes no guarantees for side effects. We will stop chasing the tails, the example from `main.ml` is "okay" behaviour from the pov of the language.
```ml
    let v' = signal_get_data (advance k v2 v) in
    update heap.cursor v'.head v'.tail;
```
- Clean up of channels => "Channels are not stored anyway", but may need to be if we have sort of "here is this channel, using this file".
  - If anyone creates a bunch of channels, there is no way for the channels to be cleaned up. They will remain on the ocaml heap until the program terminates.
  - A fix could be: weak reference for the channel resources. Something to go through channels and clean, a timer or part of a step?.

## Next time:

- Try to implement extensible channels, the producer pattern.
- **End game**: we are reaching the handin date, about 4 weeks from now.
  - The report is top priority!
  - Feedback: If we want feedback, then **we should have a draft (at least) a week before** the hand-in which is about the 8th of December. We could also decide to get feedback while writing, "I finished section 2, could you look at it?".
