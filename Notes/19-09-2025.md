Reformulate last part so we say it should be a library implementation

we pick OCaml as the host language

Keep meetings on Fridays (but not next week)

Material in simplified Rattus, maybe better available in a few weeks

We need a constructor for things like never, delay sync, wait, head, tail (maybe as a discriminated union type)

This languages Chan type is not the same as what we normally have
(something that says "please use this name to send something on")
(kind of like sending to a port)
(also in the paper, so read about it here)
(lust a global list of channels?? probably not)

Difference between O with Exists and Forall:
https://bahr.io/pubs/files/asyncratt-paper.pdf (read first 2 sections)
If exists, then it later exists of a promise that you get it in the future, and a clock that if it ticks then you get the data at a certain time (there exists a clock where ... ??)

## TODO
- Look into GADTs (generalized algebraic data types) for implementing the type system
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type
  - understand how it works in ocaml
- read AsyncRatt paper
  - Later and delayOnce
  - Chan
  - (We can consider the boxes as signals)
  - https://bahr.io/pubs/files/asyncratt-paper.pdf


We need to have a Later, delayOnce, Chan and Signal type
