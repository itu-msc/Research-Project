## Questions

- What happens in `advance` semantics for `Trig` when the update-flag is not set to updated?
- Ticked for tail splits the heap in $N_1,\ell,N_2$. Is it important that we only consider part of the heap before it?
	- Say $\ell$ is somewhere in the middle of the heap. Are only allowed to consider from start to $\ell$ when trying to determine if $w$ ticked?
