## Questions

- For something like `setOutput`, how are we supposed to run something when something is stepped?
  - `setOutput` for example says it takes a signal and a producer function. So when the signal head updates, how are we supposed to run the producer function?
- Should it be possible to read a value from a signal multiple times in the same tick?
  - For example, if we have a signal `s` and we read its value twice in the same tick, should we get the same value both times?
  - Or should we get an error if we try to read it multiple times in the same tick?
- How should we be doing the clock?
  - Do we need to make it in a new thread?
  - If so, do we need to set a mutex on the step function?

- could we double check if the generic channel implementation looks good?
