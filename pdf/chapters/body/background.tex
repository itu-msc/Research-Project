\subsection{channels}
\subsection{signals}
%the type and how to construct these
% You cannot have a headless signal 
\subsection{the heap}
%Conceptually, how the heap should work

\section{Rizzo Core private methods}
%The core, whatever "glues" the concepts together, making it a language

\subsection{Heap implementation}
%Stuff like step, advance, 
%Concrete implementation, why a linked list? Why weak referecen etc. Also the "alloc" to create signals.

\section{Using Rizzo}
%user space, examples of how to use it?
%Input channels : Clock signals, console signal, 
%Output "channels":
