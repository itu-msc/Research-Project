\section{Report Overview}\label{overview}
We will in this report present the implementation of Rizzo, a functional reactive programming (FRP) library implemented in Ocaml, based on the design presented in \cite{rizzo}.

The report is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In Chapter \ref{chapter:background} we will present the necessary background knowledge needed to understand the implementation of Rizzo. This includes a brief introduction to FRP, an overview of the Asynchronous Rattus calculus and a user perspective on how to use Rizzo.
    \item In Chapter \ref{rizzo_core} we will present the core implementation of Rizzo. We will go through the main components of Rizzo and explain how they work together to provide the FRP functionality.
    \item In Chapter \ref{conclusion} we will conclude the report by summarizing our findings and discussing potential future work. 
\end{itemize}
