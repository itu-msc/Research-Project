\subsubsection{Following sections}

In section \ref{background} we describe the point of departure for the following
text. We present a simple processor model which serves as basis for the
following sections. These sections add additional concepts to the model
described in section \ref{background}.

In sections \ref{preface} and \ref{memory} we describe computer memory and its
historical context, detailing the growing disparity between CPU and and memory
speeds as well as the caching mechanism introduced to increase processor
performance. This is followed by sections \ref{locality} and
\ref{cache-prefetching}, which describe the utilization of memory caches
(locality of reference) and cache prefetching, respectively.

In section \ref{instruction-pipeline} we describe instruction level parallelism
and pipelining as a means to increase throughput in the CPU.  Finally, in
section \ref{branch-prediction}, we describe the branch prediction mechanism and
qualify its usefulness in relation to the previous section.
