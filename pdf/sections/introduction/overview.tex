\subsection{Report Overview}\label{overview}
In this report we present the implementation of Rizzo, a functional reactive programming (FRP) library in OCaml, based on the design of~\cite{rizzo_modal_2025}.

The report is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Section~\ref{using_rizzo} introduces Rizzo through a small example, which serves to illustrate the core abstractions and how a programmar uses Rizzo.
    % \item In Section~\ref{section:rizzo_core} we will present the core implementation of Rizzo. We will go through the main components of Rizzo and explain how they work together to provide the FRP functionality.
    \item Section~\ref{section:implementing_rizzo} presents the implementation of Rizzo. Section~\ref{section:rizzo_types}  details the encoding of Rizzo's core types and Section~\ref{section:rizzo_core} explains the runtime components that implement Rizzo's reactive behaviour.
    \item In Section~\ref{section:conclusion} we conclude the report with summary our findings and a discussion of directions for future work. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Report Overview}\label{overview}

This report describes the design and implementation of \emph{Rizzo}, a functional reactive programming (FRP) library implemented in OCaml, following the formal model introduced by Rizzo et al.~\cite{rizzo_modal_2025}. Our focus is on translating the abstract design into a concrete, type-safe implementation and explaining the key mechanisms that support reactivity.
